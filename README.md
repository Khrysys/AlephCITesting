Aleph is a chess engine combining a cross-attention transformer evaluator with a
search-contempt MCTS algorithm. It is designed to be strong and efficient, built
on modern research in computer chess.

The name "Aleph" refers first to Aleph-Null, the smallest infinity from set
theory in mathematics, and is second a nod to AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero,
whose empirical data informed the decisions for the neural network architecture.

## Status

Aleph is currently under extremely early development. The code within this repo is not a functional engine yet. More is written than is shown here, however, I am taking time to ensure a high standard before adding code from my local copy into `staging`, and then an even higher quality before adding it into the `main` branch. Often therefore the `staging` branch is broken. However, `main` is always functional.

## Requirements

Aleph requires no special runtime dependencies beyond the standard C++20-compatible runtime. A GPU is optional, however CPU-only usage of the neural network is considerably slower and worse-performing than the GPU-accelerated performance.
